With ImgTagFanOut, you can effortlessly tag your images and automatically organize them into subdirectories based on these tags. This makes it easy to share specific sets of images with individuals or groups, ensuring everyone gets the pictures that matter most to them.

## Features

- **Effortless Image Tagging**: Simply select a directory containing your images and assign to each of them tag labels to them, making it easy to categorize your collection.

- **Automatic Tag-Based Organization**: ImgTagFanOut automatically creates subdirectories for each tag, ensuring your images are neatly organized for easy access.

- **Customizable Output Directory**: Choose a destination directory where the organized images will be copied, allowing you to keep your original collection intact.

## How It Works

3. **Automatic Organization**: ImgTagFanOut will create subdirectories for each tag and copy the tagged images into the appropriate subdirectories.

4. **Share with Ease**: Share the subdirectories with friends, family, or colleagues, ensuring they receive the images relevant to them.
